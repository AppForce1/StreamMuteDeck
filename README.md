This Chrome extension showcases controlling the Stream Video Demo using an [Elgato](https://www.elgato.com/us/en) StreamDeck or similar hardware device.

It is required to have the [MuteDeck](https://mutedeck.com/) desktop app installed. MuteDeck is an application bridging the gap between browserbased calling applications and a hardware device like a StreamDeck. Beyond StreamDecks, MuteDeck also supports [LoupeDeck](https://loupedeck.com/) and [TouchPortal](https://www.touch-portal.com/).
